2013 Sprints

- the distutils upload command omits some meta-data (long_description)
- the upload handler doesn't allow registration of a new package
- distutils doesn't allow specifying https, nor does it default to https








Now:

- patch python 2.5 to use the name "Cheese Shop" and the new URL
- PEP for metadata 1.2
  http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0345.html
- support .egg format uploads
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=513503&aid=1229137&group_id=66150
- incorporate Ian Bicking's XML-RPC API
  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/catalog-sig/2005-May/000634.html
- auto-generate download_urls for package uploads


Sooner:

- command-line tool to query pypi and fetch entries
- table structure and query support for checking dependencies
  - table structure has columns for identification of the release
    - add a specification ID to release_*?
    - or just use release, name
  - table also has a column for each of <, <=, ==, >=, > so queries are
    easier to form

Later:

- change notification emails
- "latest changes"
- admin interface for user details editing (and fix theller@python.net)
- "does this release supercede the existing release?"
